list 4 ways to accelerate electrons

1. Increase the electric field strength
2. Increase the potential difference
3. Increase the wave frequency of the electromagnetic field
4. Increase the mass of the electrons

how do you do point 4

Increasing the mass of electrons can be achieved in a variety of ways including using a particle accelerator, such as a cyclotron, or a linear accelerator, to increase the energy of the particles. Additionally, the mass of electrons can be increased by using an electron beam ion source to add additional electrons to the beam.


list some maths that describe an "electron beam ion source "

1. The Lorentz force equation: F = qE + qv x B
2. The Maxwell equations: Gauss's law, Faraday's law, Ampere's law, and Ohm's law
3. The Schrodinger equation: Hψ = Eψ
4. The Poisson equation: ∇2φ = -ρ/ε
5. The Helmholtz equation: ∇2A + k2A = 0
6. The Navier-Stokes equations: ∂u/∂t + (u·∇)u = -1/ρ∇p + ν∇2u


use the Poisson equation: ∇2φ = -ρ/ε to plot a 2 dimension graph around an accelerated electron beam ion source


The equation can be solved numerically using finite-difference methods. The graph produced by this equation would be a 2D contour plot showing the electric potential (φ) surrounding an accelerated electron beam ion source. The graph would show a decrease in electric potential with increasing distance from the source.
